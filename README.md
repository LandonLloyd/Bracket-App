# Bracket-App

A small bracket app I am making using HTML/CSS/JS for events and tournaments!

# Live Deployment

# Latest Feature

The latest feature implemented into this app is the ability to clear teams so you can re-enter teams.

# Updates

This app is no longer in development. Maybe when I finish some other things up I will come back and finish this app!
